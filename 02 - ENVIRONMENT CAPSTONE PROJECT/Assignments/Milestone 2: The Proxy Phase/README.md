# Milestone 2: The Proxy Phase

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The second milestone is a bit more involved and often takes more time. The blockout stage lays down the foundation for the scene. The <strong>Proxy Phase</strong> is where you start refining that blockout and transforming the elements into something more closely resembling their final form.</p>
<p>This stage usually involves creating midpoly geometry based on your graybox. Often times you'll create proxy materials using simple colors to help break up the scene a bit to help with imagining final form.</p>
<p>This is also the stage where you start building out your modular kits and planning out your primary trim sheets.</p>
