# Milestone 3: Final Level Art

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Final Art phase usually takes the most time. This is where you are creating all of your materials and trim sheets, modeling the final art for all your architecture and major props, and working out the overall tone of your scene. This is also the phase where you are laying down your first set dressing pass.</p>
<p>Completing this milestone means your primary level art is done. However, you may still iterate on it in the polish phase.</p>
