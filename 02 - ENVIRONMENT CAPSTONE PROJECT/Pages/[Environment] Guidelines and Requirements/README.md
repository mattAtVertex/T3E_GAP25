<h1>Guidelines for your Environment Capstone Project</h1>
<p>The aim of these guidelines is to help you manage the scope of your project so that at the end of the 14 week course, you have a complete environment for your portfolio.</p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a small or contained space</li>
<li>Reasonable scope</li>
<li>Define focal points</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things to Consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is the setting? Time period and place?</li>
<li>What is the story behind your environment?</li>
<li>What kind of gameplay would your scene likely contain?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Term 3 is <strong>14 weeks</strong>. The goal is at the end of the 14 weeks, you will have a finished project ready to show in your portfolio.</p>
<h2>About Scope</h2>
<p>It's really easy to get inspired by grand ambitions. Try not to let yourself get caught in the trap. We want to be able to finish this and we want to be able to have something to show at the end. Try to identify early on where you can cut back on scope if you need to. This goes especially for environment artists. You can always go back and build more later, try keeping your Capstone to a smaller area and focus on that.</p>
