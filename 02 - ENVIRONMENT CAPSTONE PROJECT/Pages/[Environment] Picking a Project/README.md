# [Environment] Picking a Project

<h2>Choosing a Concept</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to do is pick a concept for our scene. Keep in mind that the project that you decide to do here is what you will be working on for the rest of this 14 week term. It's also best to come up with a couple of different options that you can pick from. You will also want to have some options here to make sure you follow a project that maintains a reasonable scope that you are capable of achieving by the end of the term.</p>

<h2>Where do I get a Concept From?</h2>
<p>Your concept can come from a multitude of places. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A piece of concept art (remember to credit the concept artist!)</li>
<li>A scene from a game you like</li>
<li>A piece of creative commons artwork</li>
<li>A photograph of a real place you want to translate into a real time environment</li>
<li>A scene from a movie you want to turn into a game environment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things to Consider when Choosing your Concept</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use a small or contained space</li>
<li>Evaluate for a reasonable scope</li>
<li>Define your focal points early on</li>
<li>Pick something that aligns with your North Star</li>
</ul>
